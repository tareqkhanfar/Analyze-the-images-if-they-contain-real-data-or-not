# Analyze the images if they contain real data or not
Stegno-Analyzer is a Python-based project that helps analyze and identify images containing hidden data using various algorithms. 
The project uses the LSB (Least Significant Bit) algorithm to embed and extract data within images. 
It then checks whether the extracted data is meaningful and relevant using the Jaccard, Minimum Edit Distance, and N-gram algorithms.

Stegno-Analyzer is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use.
It can be used by anyone who wants to analyze images for hidden data, such as security analysts, investigators, or researchers.
The project also includes documentation and examples to help users get started.

# Features
Analyze images for hidden data using the LSB algorithm
Check whether the extracted data is meaningful and relevant using the Jaccard, Minimum Edit Distance, and N-gram algorithms
Detect whether the hidden data is dummy or not using the Jaccard algorithm
Include the Minimum Edit Distance and N-gram algorithms for further analysis and verification of the data
Designed to be user-friendly and easy to use
Include documentation and examples to help users get started
Designed to be secure and reliable

# Usage
Stegno-Analyzer is designed to be secure and reliable. It includes measures to protect the data being analyzed and to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. However, 
it's important to note that no system can be completely foolproof, and users should always exercise caution and common sense when analyzing sensitive data.
